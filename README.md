- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jason-XY-Zhou, a weakling and couch potato, coding my way through life one snack at a time! 😅💻
- 🌱 I’m currently working on surviving the day and learning how to lift ... my spirits and my code quality.
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate fellow sedentary enthusiasts on cool projects.
- 🤔 Always pondering life's biggest questions, like "Why doesn't my code work?" and "What's for lunch?"
- 🎮 My idea of exercise is debugging while watching YouTube.
- 🌟 I believe in writing code that's lazy but efficient.
- 🐱 My cat is my code reviewer, and yes, he judges me.
- 📫 How to reach me: jasonxyzhou623@gmail.com
